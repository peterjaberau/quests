- Avoid `any` and NEVER use `as any`.
- NEVER use non-null assertions (`!`).
- We use kebab case for filenames.
- We use non-default exports whenever possible.
- NEVER add comments for sections of JSX like `{/* Header */}<Header />`
- DO NOT fix ESLint `perfectionist/*` plugin issues, the editor will automatically fix them when the code is saved.

## Perfectionist Rules

- Objects, interfaces, types, and other sortable structures are automatically sorted by the perfectionist ESLint plugin
- The editor will automatically fix sorting when code is saved
- Do not manually sort these structures as the plugin will handle it

## Tailwind Rules

- Use `size-` over `w-` and `h-` when width and height are the same.
- Use `gap-x-` or `gap-y-` over `space-x` or `space-y` for gap.

## Zod Rules

- Prefer `z.output` over `z.infer` for type inference.
